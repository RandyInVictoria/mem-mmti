  <p class="tab-intro">Compliance and enforcement (C&E) activities begin after a claim is staked and continue through exploration and the life of a mine. The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (EMPR), Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy (ENV) and Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) work together to provide integrated oversight of British Columbiaâ€™s mining sector. Records of inspections conducted during the 2016 calendar year can be found below.
